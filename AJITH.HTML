      a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in
      the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during
      her maiden voyage <br />
      from Southampton, UK, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated
      2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the
      deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the
      deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship.[4] The
      disaster drew public attention, provided foundational material for the
      disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic works. RMS Titanic was
      the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of
      three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was
      built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the
      chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[5] Titanic
      was under the command of Captain Edward Smith,[6] who went down with the
      ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world,
      as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland,
      Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life
      in the United States and Canada. The first-class accommodation was
      designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium,
      swimming pool,<br />
      libraries, high-class restaurants, and opulent cabins. A high-powered
      radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger
      "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use.[7] Titanic had advanced
      safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated
      watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as "unsinkable". Titanic
      was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three
      lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats; she carried only 20 lifeboats, four of
      which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking.[8]
      Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people—about half the number
      of passengers on board, and one third of the number of passengers the ship
      could have carried at full capacity (consistent with the maritime safety
      regulations of the era). When the ship sank, many of the lifeboats that
      had been lowered were only about half full.
